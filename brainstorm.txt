Basic Brainstorming Rules 

1. Capture all ideas.
2. Do not evaluate and never criticize.
3. Work for quantity to allow quality ideas to surface.
4. Welcome piling on. Use other ideas as launch pads. 
5. Allow a free-for-all.
6. Encourage big thinking.

Chosen Idea:
What was listed above; I just went first and, as far as I can tell, we just all kind of agreed on that.

Add a new file called "sketch.jpg" to your GitHub project of a scretch of your chosen idea.

Why did you group chose this idea? In other words, why was this idea evaluated higher than your other ideas. Explain with at least 3 sentences.
It was quite simple, actually.  I just went first, and I'm not sure whether anyone else had any other ideas or whether they just liked mine the best, but I mostly only remember Aiden talking with me about it.  He said that he thought the idea was pretty cool, and I guess we just decided that that would be our project.
